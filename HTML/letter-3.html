            <p>My dear brother</p>
            <p>
               Thank you a thousand times for the money. <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-2"></a> Some day I will explain to you how it has saved me – for it is wrong for me to take
               it when you need it most yourself. Thank you for your letters and affection. I am
               glad you are to be married <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-3"></a> – but I know this – that if you are happy (as I expect) you will not need me, and
               if you are unhappy your pride will cut you off from me. But nothing can destroy the
               deep and essential affection. <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-4"></a> I want to know Theresa. 
               
            </p>
            <p>
               If you <em>could</em> come, I could tell you much more than in letters. It would be a great happiness too.
               But I shall try to give you more in my letters. 
               
            </p>
            <p>
               Ever your devoted brother

                  <li id="footnote-2"><span class="footnote-label"> p. 5 , n 3</span> On 12 June, HWE said he was ‘very proud’, ‘very happy’, ‘very frightened’, ‘quite in love’ with Theresa Garrett. On 9 Aug., he thanked TSE for his ‘kindly letter’ about the engagement: but TSE’s letter has not been located.

                  <li id="footnote-3"><span class="footnote-label"> p. 5 , n 4</span> HWE wrote on 9 Aug.: ‘I have written to you frequently with a degree of self-revelation which I have never even approximated with any other person . . . Any other person than yourself would undoubtedly misunderstand me completely and censure me severely. My faith persists that you do, in a measure at least, understand me. I have a similar faith that I can understand anything that you might wish to write me about yourself.’
