            <p>My dear Henry,</p>
            <p>
               I have so much to write to you about that I must divide it into two or three letters.
               The three chief subjects are 
               
               <ul class="unnumbered">
                  <li> Hydraulic 
                     
                     <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-2"></a></li>
                  <li> the Bank </li>
                  <li> Mother’s visit </li>
               </ul>
               
            </p>
            <p>
               I will only deal in this letter with the latter two. 
               
            </p>
            <p> 
                Of course I must thank you for your goodness in writing so often, and keeping me
               posted about finance in America, and for your last admirable letter. And most of all for your latest extraordinary generosity. About your cheque: I imagine
               that you sent it under the impression that I had either just left the bank, or that
               I was just about to leave. <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-3"></a> There are three reasons why I have not yet done so and cannot at the present time.
               But I feel that I ought to return it to you: I will either do that, or else invest
               it until needed, as you prefer. Please say. I do not want to take it under any misapprehension
               on your part. But if I invest it, I think I shall return it to you to invest for me in America, as I do not like sinking any more money in  England at the present juncture. 
               
            </p>
            <p>
               I cannot possibly leave the bank at present, because of the way in which they have
               
               treated me.  In spite of the fact that I have been absent about ten or eleven weeks
               during the past year, owing to Vivien’s illness, and constantly late, they have  raised my salary to five hundred pounds,
               at a time when they are raising very few salaries indeed. But this is not the main point. That is that they have shown me in  word and deed
               that they value my services very highly indeed, and have placed me in  a position
               of responsibility such that I cannot resign now without letting them down very badly
               and behaving with ingratitude. I am now head of an Intelligence  Department with a number of clerks under me, and in sole charge. I have had to organise
               the department, and the organisation is still far from complete. On the contrary,
               they are just on the point of enlarging the scope of the department much more. The
               heads of the bank are anxious to make a big thing of it; and I know quite well that
               there is at present no one else in the bank but myself who can do it for them – that
               is, the one or two men who might do it are not available for this post. This is not
               a boast: it is simply the fact that there happens to be no one available with the
               proper qualifications, and as a matter of fact they had me in view from the inception
               of the idea. The bank is getting bigger and bigger, with interests practically all
               over the world, and affiliated banks everywhere, and there is the opportunity to create
               a service of Intelligence which would be quite unique. It has involved very heavy
               work so far: I have had to draft schemes, and at the same time attend to a mass of
               detail, such as the running of a printing press (which is always breaking down) and
               the holidays and attendances and personal grievances of the clerks; and although I
               have much more liberty of movement than before, I have had to be at the bank early
               and late to get the work done. And with it all I have to read ten or fifteen papers
               a day to try to keep myself posted on all sorts of subjects, such as foreign budgets,
               movements of crops, agricultural banks, oil developments, and what not. In addition,
               I am still unfortunately the only person in the bank who knows anything about the
               Peace Treaties, and there are two or three big lawsuits with Germans coming on this
               winter which involve an intimate knowledge of their history for the past four years,
               which no one else possesses. You will think that I have got excited about all this,
               but the fact remains that if I left the bank now I should simply be hanging another
               millstone round my conscience. The bank took me in without knowing anything about
               me whatever, when I was absolutely on the rocks in 1917, and has treated me with extraordinary
               kindness ever since. Of course this big expansion of the Intelligence work has only
               happened since my decision to leave: this summer I was merely running a daily newspaper
               of extracts from the foreign press, with another man, and it would not have been nearly
               so disconcerting for the bank if I had left then. 
               
            </p>
            <p>
               This is my main reason. Another reason is the social uncertainty, owing to the
               alarming rise of the Labour Party to power. <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-1"></a> It has thrown England into great anxiety and confusion: no one knows what sort of
               living  conditions we shall have in six months from now. I have been working toward getting a position in journalism under Lord Rothermere. <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-1"></a> I am in sympathy with his views, in general, and he is one of the very richest and
               most powerful men in England. This, of course, is the reason why I have stuck so hard to the <i class="title">Criterion</i>; the support and backing of the Rothermeres is something which is worth working for.
               I have not worked for immediate profit – for in fact I have not had a penny from it,
               except ordinary payments for contributions – but with a view to solidifying myself
               with the Rothermeres. I saw Lord Rothermere today, and he said that the political
               situation was so dangerous that he would not consider inviting me to leave the bank,
               or indeed consider any expansion of his interests or development of his papers, until
               the situation had cleared up, and he told me to see him again at the middle of March.
               <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-2"></a> 
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps it is as well that I should not leave just now, from some points of view.
               I am so jaded, with the anxiety of the past year, that I simply cannot write decent
               prose: my last articles in the Dial are deplorable; <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-3"></a> and until I can get my mind into better shape I should simply ruin my reputation
               by writing at all. 
            </p>
            <p> Now about mother. This time, I feel that it [is] impossible for me to take the responsibility
               either of urging her to come or urging her to remain. We have been keeping on our flat, and Ellen, <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-4"></a> simply because we felt that mother would not want to come to any other place; we should otherwise have disposed of it a year ago and found a place which [would]
               both have been cheaper and more pleasant to us, but we could have found nothing so
               suitable in comfort and convenience for mother. Or we should have let this flat profitably
               on a long lease. If the Labour Party come in, and there is a big panic and depression,
               we may find it very difficult to dispose of. But if mother comes, what I should do
               is this. I have a very nice, intelligent, serious Scotch woman [Miss Duff], who has
               been coming to me about twice a week for the past year to do secretarial work. She
               is engaged in the  daytime as a typist in a city office, but she is tired of city work. She is about
               forty, and has for me the great advantage of knowing French well. I should engage
               her as a resident secretary–housekeeper. I should put her in to Clarence Gate to look after mother, with Ellen to cook, and Miss Duff could go about with mother and would be a much better person than Marion<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-1"></a> – tactful and placid. Marion could thus get some holiday out of it, and perhaps could go into the country for
               a bit with Vivien. Then I should engage a car so that mother need do nothing on foot or in buses, and
               I would go away with her sometimes for weekends. 
               
            </p>
            <p>
               And I think that I could come and fetch mother.I could only come to New York and meet her at the boat, and leave <em>immediately</em> (I don’t know whether there is any passport or other red tape to interfere). I don’t conceal that this would be a considerable sacrifice. I would take most of
               my holiday (which is three weeks and three days and not a day more in a year) to do
               that, and it would mean giving up certain other plans of which I shall speak later.
               But the immediate point is this: I do not see any point in arranging a convoy for
               mother one way, if she has to be alone the other. I could not possibly make two voyages.
               If I brought mother over, could you come and take her back ? It would of course be
               a big sacrifice for you too, and tantalising to come all the way to Europe and not
               be able to stay, but unless you can do this I do not see how mother can come. 
               
            </p>
            <p>    
               What I want you to do is to think over the plan for mother’s stay <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-2"></a> which I have outlined, and consider whether you think it feasible, and also whether
               you could escort mother either to England or back from England, and wire me yes or
               no at once. I cannot afford to remain in a state of suspense, as important plans of
               my own depend on this; and I cannot make the arrangements for Miss Duff etc. without
               knowing your opinion. In fact, our whole life is in suspense on account of the uncertainty
               of mother’s visit. 
               
            </p>
            <p>
               If mother could not come – and if you think she should not come – I would come to
               America; but I have always felt that a visit of four or five days, such as mine must be limited
               to, would be more pain than pleasure to mother. 
               
            </p>
            <p>
               Please wire me as quickly as you can. 
               
            </p>
            <p>
               I shall try to write about other subjects within a few days. I am very tired. My fatigue,
               which has been growing for years, is not solely due to overwork and anxieties: it
               is largely due to the kink in my brain <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-1"></a> which makes life at all an unremitting strain for me, and which is at the bottom
               of a good many of the things about me that you object to.
