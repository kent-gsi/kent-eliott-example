            <p>My dear brother,</p>
            <p>
               I have just returned from Paris, where I had a very busy and tiring week. I shall go soon again. Apart from my own reasons for being there, I have unfortunately
               a very large acquaintance in Paris, whom, or some of whom, I have to see – one would
               meet them on the street anyhow: I am much more protected in London, and it is a real rest to be here, however busy one is. I like the little house, and there are flowers in the garden now, lupins and violas
               and a few roses. And it is premature to give it up yet. V. may be able to live in
               it again. I don’t know. The signs are not very encouraging. She is very affectionate
               and gentle, and her regrets and self-accusations are terribly pathetic; she is very
               grateful to everyone in the home, and says they are very good to her. She does not
               want to leave, so far; the worry will begin when she does. Her beliefs in persecution
               are unshaken, and she still hears voices. But she has not made any attempt on her
               life for over a fortnight. 
               
            </p>
            <p>
               I don’t know whether I thanked you for the money. It was very useful. I am gradually
               clearing up the mess. The Haigh-Woods have been very good and very helpful; but they
               are both infirm, and I found them, in Paris, something of a responsibility themselves.
               The doctors have not yet ventured on any prophecy. If she has to remain there, or
               somewhere, indefinitely, it will mean something like £500 a year. Of course, if I
               eventually get rid of this house, which I am loath to do, I can live quite inexpensively
               by myself. What seems likely is that in September, I shall try to let it for the winter;
               if V. is at large we could spend the winter at Rapallo, and I could make periodical visits to England; for in any case I think she had better stay out of England for a year or so. 
               
            </p>
            <p>
               What I am telling mother, and people generally, is that V. got very run down on our
               travels, had a touch of influenza, did not want to start again in England until she
               was quite fit to keep house, and decided to go into a country sanatorium in France
               to get fit. I have not mentioned the address to <em>anyone</em>: it is so well known that the word “Malmaison” is almost synonymous with insanity.
               
               
            </p>
            <p>
               I shall rejoice when I get the first letter from you.
               
            </p>
            <p>
               Ever your affectionate brother

               I would write to Theresa if I knew her address. She wrote a sweet letter to V. but
               as I said it was undesirable to give it to her.
