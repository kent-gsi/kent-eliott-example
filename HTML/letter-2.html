            <p>Dearest Mother:</p>
            <p>
               <i class="title">The Criterion</i> has this minute gone to press and I am so tired that I want to lie down and sleep
               for a year. 
               
            </p>
            <p>
               Today I received your two letters dated 25 and 23 March. <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-2"></a>Thank you very much. 
               
            </p>
            <p>
               I enclose in this letter two copies of press cuttings which have been sent me from
               America. As one concerns Cousin Charles<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-3"></a> and the other concerns your youngest son,<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-4"></a> I am in hopes that they may have interest for you.
               
            </p>
            <p>
               In a few days Vivien and I will go to the country for three weeks to the cottage at
               Fishbourne. Please continue, however, to write to this address. 
               
            </p>
            <p>
               Vivien is much better. She has been writing since Christmas and although her output is small
               she has met with extraordinary success. There is no doubt whatever that she has talent. She should have been encouraged to
               write years ago. She has already a very exceptional and individual style. 
               
            </p>
            <p>
               Please oblige me by keeping an <em>open mind</em> with regard to coming to London this summer. There is no need for you to make long
               and elaborate preparations. There is no need for you to give me long warning. I shall
               be here all the summer probably alone. So keep an <em>open mind</em>. <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnote-5"></a>

                  <li id="footnote-1"><span class="footnote-label"> p. 5 , n 1</span> This letter, transcribed within a letter from CCE to HWE of 17 Apr., was probably written over the weekend of 11–12 Apr., since TSE went to Fishbourne on Monday 13th.  
                
                  </li>
                  <li id="footnote-2"><span class="footnote-label"> p. 5 , n 2</span> On 23 Mar., CCE said she thought the last C. was ‘one of the best’, especially TSE’s article on ‘Elizabethan Dramatists’; and she was looking forward to ‘the book’. She thought his style had ‘improved’, and noted he had ‘given up parentheses’. 
                  </li>
                  <li id="footnote-3"><span class="footnote-label"> p. 5 , n 3</span> President Charles William Eliot of Harvard University, whose ninetieth birthday was celebrated at Harvard on 20 Mar. 1924. See Charles William Eliot: The Man and his Beliefs, with a Biographical Study by President Neilson (1926).
                  </li>
                  <li id="footnote-4"><span class="footnote-label"> p. 5 , n 4</span> ‘T. S. Eliot in a Nutshell’, New York Herald (Mar. 1924), reported that TSE was ‘a man of abundant health and great vigor’. 
                  </li>
                  <li id="footnote-5"><span class="footnote-label"> p. 5 , n 5</span> Having transcribed TSE’s letter, CCE told HWE: ‘I have sent an immediate answer . . . that with increasing age I had become timid about going abroad with Marian, and that I had written you I had rather pay your passage and be away a month with you than a longer time with Marian . . . Tom’s letter did not sound as though he expected me very much . . . I do not think he would have much time to give me. Vivien would have to be his first thought and I should be much alone. It does not look to me very attractive – I think I should be lonely.’
