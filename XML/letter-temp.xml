                I cannot possibly leave the bank at present, because of the way in which they have
                treated me. In spite of the fact that I have been absent about ten or eleven weeks
                during the past year, owing to Vivien’s illness, and constantly late, they have  raised my salary to five hundred pounds, at a time when they are raising very few salaries indeed. But this is not the main point. That is that they have shown me in  word and deed that they value my services very highly indeed, and have placed me in  a position of responsibility such that I cannot resign now without letting them down very badly and behaving with ingratitude. I am now head of an Intelligence    <page-break pn="2" /> Department with a number of clerks under me, and in sole charge. I have had to organise the department, and the organisation is still far from complete. On the contrary, they are just on the point of enlarging the scope of the department much more. The heads of the bank are anxious to make a big thing of it; and I know quite well that there is at present no one else in the bank but myself who can do it for them – that is, the one or two men who might do it are not available for this post. This is not a boast: it is simply the fact that there happens to be no one available with the proper qualifications, and as a matter of fact they had me in view from the inception of the idea. The bank is getting bigger and bigger, with interests practically all over the world, and affiliated banks everywhere, and there is the opportunity to create a service of Intelligence which would be quite unique. It has involved very heavy work so far: I have had to draft schemes, and at the same time attend to a mass of detail, such as the running of a printing press (which is always breaking down) and the holidays and attendances and personal grievances of the clerks; and although I have much more liberty of movement than before, I have had to be at the bank early and late to get the work done. And with it all I have to read ten or fifteen papers a day to try to keep myself posted on all sorts of subjects, such as foreign budgets, movements of crops, agricultural banks, oil developments, and what not. In addition, I am still unfortunately the only person in the bank who knows anything about the Peace Treaties, and there are two or three big lawsuits with Germans coming on this winter which involve an intimate knowledge of their history for the past four years, which no one else possesses. You will think that I have got excited about all this, but the fact remains that if I left the bank now I should simply be hanging another millstone round my conscience. The bank took me in without knowing anything about me whatever, when I was absolutely on the rocks in 1917, and has treated me with extraordinary kindness ever since. Of course this big expansion of the Intelligence work has only happened since my decision to leave: this summer I was merely running a daily newspaper of extracts from the foreign press, with another man, and it would not have been nearly so disconcerting for the bank if I had left then.

                This is my main reason. Another reason is the social uncertainty, <note n="1" type="source-book"> <note-target>owing to the
                alarming rise of the Labour Party to power.</note-target> <note-content> At the
                General Election on 6 Dec. 1923 the Conservatives were defeated, and on 23 Jan. 1924 Ramsay MacDonald formed the first Labour government in Britain. </note-content></note> It has thrown England into great anxiety and confusion: no one knows what sort of living <page-break pn="3" /> conditions we shall have in six months from now. <note n="1" type="source-book"><note-target> I have been working toward getting a position in journalism under Lord Rothermere.</note-target> <note-content> Harold Sidney Harmsworth, first Viscount Rothermere (1868–1940): proprietor of the Daily Mirror , Sunday Pictorial , Glasgow Daily Record , Evening News and Sunday Mail . Harold Harmsworth also shared ownership of Associated Newspapers with his elder brother, Alfred, first Viscount Northcliffe. On the death of his brother in 1922, Harold acquired his controlling interest in Associated Newspapers, including the Daily Mail , for £1.6 million.</note> I am in sympathy with his views, in general, and he is one of the very richest and most powerful men in England. This, of course, is the reason why I have stuck so hard to the Criterion ; the support and backing of the Rothermeres is something which is worth working for. I have not worked for immediate profit – for in fact I have not had a penny from it, except ordinary payments for contributions – but with a view to solidifying myself with the Rothermeres. I saw Lord Rothermere today, and he said that the political situation was so dangerous that he would not consider inviting me to leave the bank, or indeed consider any expansion of his interests or development of his papers, until the situation had cleared up, and he told me to see him again at the middle of March. <note n="2" type="source-book">Since Viscount Rothermere was estranged from his wife, Lilian (she had had an affair with his younger brother), who was the sole financial backer of the Criterion , it is possible that he might have been disingenuous in his dealings with TSE.</note> Perhaps it is as well that I should not leave just now, from some points of view. I am so jaded, with the anxiety of the past year, that I simply cannot write decent prose: my last articles in the Dial are deplorable; <note n="3" type="source-book">TSE, ‘Letters from London’, Dial 73: 3 &amp; 6 (Sept. &amp; Dec. 1922).</note> and until I can get my mind into better shape I should simply ruin my reputation by writing at all. Now about mother. This time, I feel that it [is] impossible for me to take the responsibility either of urging her to come or urging her to remain. We have been keeping on our flat, and Ellen, <note n="4" type="source-book">Ellen Kellond, who had been the Eliots’ maid since 1918. </note> simply because we felt that mother would not want to come to any other place; we should otherwise have disposed of it a year ago and found a place which [would] both have been cheaper and more pleasant to us, but we could have found nothing so suitable in comfort and convenience for mother. Or we should have let this flat profitably on a long lease. If the Labour Party come in, and there is a big panic and depression, we may find it very difficult to dispose of. But if mother comes, what I should do is this. I have a very nice, intelligent, serious Scotch woman [Miss Duff], who has been coming to me about twice a week for the past year to do secretarial work. She is engaged in the <page-break pn="4" /> daytime as a typist in a city office, but she is tired of city work. She is about forty, and has for me the great advantage of knowing French well. I should engage her as a resident secretary–housekeeper. I should put her in to Clarence Gate to look after mother, with Ellen to cook, and Miss Duff could go about with mother and would be a much better person than Marion <note n="1" type="source-book">Marion Cushing Eliot (1877–1964) was the fourth child of Henry Ware and Charlotte Champe Eliot; TSE’s favourite sister, she had travelled with her mother to visit him in London in 1921</note> – tactful and placid. Marion could thus get some holiday out of it, and perhaps could go into the country for a bit with Vivien. Then I should engage a car so that mother need do nothing on foot or in buses, and I would go away with her sometimes for weekends.

                        And I think that I could come and fetch mother. I could only come to New York and meet her at the boat, and leave immediately (I don’t know whether there is any passport or other red tape to interfere). I don’t conceal that this would be a considerable sacrifice. I would take most of my holiday (which is three weeks and three days and not a day more in a year) to do that, and it would mean giving up certain other plans of which I shall speak later. But the immediate point is this: I do not see any point in arranging a convoy for mother one way, if she has to be alone the other. I could not possibly make two voyages. If I brought mother over, could you come and take her back ? It would of course be a big sacrifice for you too, and tantalising to come all the way to Europe and not be able to stay, but unless you can do this I do not see how mother can come.

                    <para>
                        What I want you to do is to think over the plan for mother’s stay <note n="2" type="source-book">After the success of her visit to England in 1921, TSE was counting on his mother returning in the summer of 1923. This proved impossible, and she made her second visit only in 1924.</note> which I have outlined, and consider whether you think it feasible, and also whether you could escort mother either to England or back from England, and wire me yes or no at once. I cannot afford to remain in a state of suspense, as important plans of my own depend on this; and I cannot make the arrangements for Miss Duff etc. without knowing your opinion. In fact, our whole life is in suspense on account of the uncertainty of mother’s visit.

                    <para>
                        If mother could not come – and if you think she should not come – I would come to America; but I have always felt that a visit of four or five days, such as mine must be limited to, would be more pain than pleasure to mother.

                        I shall try to write about other subjects within a few days. I am very tired. My fatigue, which has been growing for years, is not solely due to overwork and anxieties: it is largely due to the kink in my brain <note n="1" type="source-book">Cf. TSE’s letter to RA, 6 Nov. 1921, which spoke of suffering from ‘an aboulie and emotional derangement which has been a lifelong affliction’. Cf. also Celia in CP , II, 559–69: ‘Well, my upbringing was pretty conventional – / I had always been taught to disbelieve in sin. / Oh, I don’t mean that it was ever mentioned! / But anything wrong, from our point of view, / Was either bad form, or was psychological. / And bad form always led to disaster / Because the people one knew disapproved of it. / I don’t worry much about form, myself – / But when everything’s bad form, or mental kinks, / You either become bad form, and cease to care, / Or else, if you care, you must be kinky.’ </note> which makes life at all an unremitting strain for me, and which is at the bottom of a good many of the things about me that you object to.
