                  T.S. Eliot—the famed poet and essayist—and a family man, it sounds paradoxical. Indeed,
                  to the most of us, his name is associated with true linguistic sophistication, and,
                  unfortunately, unhappy marriages—he doesn't seem like a family man. We also rarely
                  study him as a family man—we direct our energy to his stoeric and elite high Modernist
                  poetry, and ironically, partly also because the influential school of literary criticism
                  he started has rendered biographical details of individual authors less relevant.
                  Beyond the paradox, however, he <em>must</em> be a family man to some people, at least to his families. This digital humanities
                  project invites you to look at another side of the liteary giant; this is a database
                  of letters Eliot wrote to his families. In those letters, he is down-to-earth, amiable,
                  and, like everyone else, worries over petty, everyday trouble. 
                  While its title may strike you as paradoxical, you will see that Eliot, for all his
                  magnificent poems and essays, is like everyone else—he, too, worries over petty, everyday
                  trouble.
